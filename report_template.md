## 🔍 Key Observations

- A significant number of users clicked on the phishing link.
- Credential submission rate was higher among new employees.
- Only a small number of users reported the email to the IT department.
- Most users accessed the phishing page via mobile devices.

---

## 📌 Risk Analysis

- **High Risk**: Users entering credentials without verifying sender authenticity.
- **Medium Risk**: Users clicking links but not reporting suspicious emails.
- **Low Risk**: Users who opened the email but did not click the link.

---

## 🧠 Recommendations

1. **Security Awareness Training**  
   Conduct mandatory quarterly training sessions covering phishing recognition.

2. **Simulated Campaigns**  
   Schedule monthly phishing simulations to reinforce good behavior.

3. **Reporting Culture**  
   Introduce an easy-to-use "Report Phishing" button in the email client.

4. **Email Filtering Enhancements**  
   Review and improve spam/phishing filters at the email gateway.

5. **Mobile Device Focus**  
   Include mobile-specific awareness tips in future training.

## ✅ Conclusion

The phishing simulation revealed critical gaps in user awareness and behavior. Implementing regular training and improving reporting mechanisms will greatly reduce the risk of real phishing attacks in the future.
